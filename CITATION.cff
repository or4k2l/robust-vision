abstract: |
  A production-ready, scalable framework for training robust vision models.
  Features include Exponential Moving Average (EMA), label smoothing, margin loss,
  multi-GPU support, and comprehensive robustness evaluation across multiple noise
  types. Designed for practitioners who need reliable, maintainable, and 
  production-grade deep learning code for computer vision applications.
